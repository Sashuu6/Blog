## Introduction

My desire to perform open source contributions started when I met my senior Ashwin Karuvally at my Post Graduation (MCA) at College of Engineering Trivandrum (CET). He was an open source contributor and a hardcore linux user.When I was at my first years, I was a windows user. Using windows was soley for playing games. He taught me why FOSS, Git and Linux and why open source contribution improves skills and lands a respectible job at top tier companies. I was very intersted in IOT and hardware programming. So I started making projects based on electronics. But before that, my contributions started by developing platform for CET MCA fest, DCOD. For that competition, I worked with the seniors to [Debugger](https://github.com/sashuu6/debugger-dcod-mca-cet) (For code decoding competion. It's like hackerrank) and [reverse engineering](https://github.com/sashuu6/reverse_engineering-dcod-mca-cet) (Hack the given database and website code and answer questions).

After the fest, I started aquiring more knowledge on micro-controllers and hardware programming and at later stages, I started taking workshops on those topics. For sharing the study materials, I used add the contents to git repositories and share them.

I have used git to version control all my lab programs I used to do when I was at CET from S1 to mini and final projects S6. I have used Git and Github develop and host my CV website, CV and blog.

These are some of the honourable projects I will done till 2019. But, when I look back at this post for few years, I will be very disappointed at my old me.

1. 3 Factor Authentication lock.
2. Python fingerprint recognition.
3. Youtube Subscriber Count.
4. Arduino Weather Station.
